    "2. Report your work in a Word document returned as a pdf. Use the template provided with this file to report your answers.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "An important application of quantum chemistry is predicting the energy difference between isomers of a given molecular formula. This information can then be used to estimate the distribution of isomers at a given temperature via the Boltzmann distribution, which tells us that the relative population of two isomers A and B at temperature T is given by\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{P_A}{P_B} = e^{\\frac{- (E_A - E_B)}{k_B T}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann's constant. Note that this equation depends only on the energy difference $E_A - E_B$. This is one of the reason why in reporting the results of quantum chemistry computations, the most informative energies to report are differences and not absolute energies (absolute energies should still be reported to verify that your results are correct).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem set you will:\n",
    "- refine your molecule-building skills\n",
    "- apply density functional theory to explore different conformational/configurational isomers of a molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that:\n",
    "- **conformational isomers**  are isomers that can be interconverted just by rotations about formally single bonds (this of rotations along a single bong in ethane).\n",
    "- **configurational isomers** are stereoisomers that can cannot be converted into one another by rotation around a single bond (you need to break a bond to convert one isomer into another). \n",

    "## Problem 1: The conformational isomers of hydrogen peroxide\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this problem is to use computational chemistry to explore the conformational isomers of hydrogen peroxide. We are interested in classifying all the stationary points (both minima or transition states).\n",
    "\n",

    "- In the first part, generate several initial structures by changing the dihedral angle $\\tau$ and optimize them with DFT using the 'b3lyp/def2-SVP' level of theory. \n",
    "One suggestion is to cosider the dihedral angles $\\phi$ = 0, 60, 120, and 180 degrees.\n",

    "- Predict the most stable conformation of HOOH and why would you expect to be so. It is OK to answer this question by searching and quoting your source.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that **two different guess geometries may lead to the same optimized structure**, so it is important to compare the energy and the structure of the optimized molecules to identify the unique isomers.\n"
